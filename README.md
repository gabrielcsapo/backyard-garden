# Backyard Garden

A personal garden planning app for tracking your yard layout, plantings, and growing schedule. Built with React Server Components, Vite, and SQLite.

## Features

- **Yard Planner** — SVG grid editor with 10 bed shapes (rectangle, circle, keyhole, spiral, hugelkultur, mandala, container, path, structure, water). Drag-and-drop placement, rotation, and companion planting intelligence.
- **Plant Library** — 78 plants with zone-relative planting windows, spacing, days to harvest, companion/incompatible relationships, crop families, and succession intervals.
- **Planting Calendar** — Gantt-style timeline showing indoor start, direct sow, transplant, and harvest windows based on your frost dates. Weekly task list with checkboxes.
- **Garden Log** — Timeline of observations, watering, fertilizing, pest sightings, harvests, and more. Quick-log from the yard editor. Harvest totals per plant.
- **Crop Rotation** — Tracks plant families per bed across seasons. Warns when the same family is planted within 3 years.
- **Succession Planting** — Nudges to re-sow eligible crops (lettuce, radish, beans, etc.) at the right interval.
- **Dashboard** — This week's tasks, recent activity, yard preview, and at-a-glance stats.
